Hello my darlings and *welcome* to Evie.Code's Github Profile! You're here because you're curious about who I am and what I do - or maybe you're a potential employer and you're sleuthing through my stuff and figuring out if I can write good code? Either way, hello and thanks for visiting.

So, what is there to see here? Well, there's my super cool projects like [Enmap] and [Josh] that I'm currently working on. Enmap is feature-complete while Josh is more of a work in progress, a different implementation with features I can't do with Enmap. Also take a look at [Snowflake] which is a blogging platform made with [React], [Zustand], [react-router-dom] and [Snowpack].

In the past, I've worked a lot on [Discord] bots using the [Discord.js] library to interact with the API itself. It's how I learned to extend my existing Javascript knowledge into the ES6+ era by creating bots like [Etiket] as well as the now defunct [Komada] framework and boilerplates like [Guidebot]. I also contributed most of [An Idiot's Guide] and created videos on [my youtube channel] over the years.

Want to chat me up? Join [My Discord]! You can also get me on [Twitter] and [Facebook] but to be honest, I don't usually check those regularly.

Wanna hire me? [Connect on LinkedIn] now!
